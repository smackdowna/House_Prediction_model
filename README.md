House Price  Prediction


In This Project we Have Take a Real state Data which consist of 550 house data in which there are 13 Features and 1 Label.
All the features describe about the home and based on the feature, price which is label is Given.

In this Model I divide the data in 8:2 ratio means if 80 percent of the data used for Training the 20 percent of the Data used for Testing .


This is Supervised Learning Method because we have  it learns from the given set of input and after the completion  of Data we used remaining data to make predictions.

In this We use the Supervised Learning Algorithms.
we have used 3 Algorithms
1. Linear Regressor.
2.Decision Tree Regressor
3.Random Forest Regressor

We used Regressor instead of classifier because we don't to classify anything from this as we need to predict the price of the House (which is labels)  from the given set of features.
